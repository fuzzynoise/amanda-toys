Amanda Toys
===========

Amanda Toys is a collection of scripts and utilities that I have written in order to help me administer Amanda backup servers.

They are primarily geared towards my workflow when working with hot-swap eSATA drives as "tapes".


Installation
------------

Get amanda-toys by cloning the repository: ::

    $ git clone git://github.com/krishardy/amanda-toys.git

Then add the path to your local repository to your PATH, or reference the scripts using absolute paths.

To initalize the toys (which creates a clean mount-tapes script for you): ::

    $ cd amanda-toys
    $ ./init


Configuration
-------------

The scripts have some bit of configuration in them.  Until I merge the configuration, open each file and look at the variable assignments in the top few lines.


Contributing
------------
