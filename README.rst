Amanda Toys
===========

Amanda Toys is a collection of scripts and utilities that I have written in order to help me administer Amanda backup servers.

They are primarily geared towards my workflow when working with hot-swap eSATA drives as "tapes".


Installation
------------

Get amanda-toys by cloning the repository: ::

    $ git clone git://github.com/fuzzynoise/amanda-toys.git

Then add the path to your local repository to your PATH, or reference the scripts using absolute paths.

To initalize the toys: ::

    $ cd amanda-toys
    $ ./init
